                       Oblivious Credential State
          draft-steele-spice-oblivious-credential-state-latest

Abstract

   Issuers of Digital Credentials enable dynamic state or status checks
   through the use of dereferenceable identifiers, that resolve to
   resources providing herd privacy.  Privacy in such systems is
   determined not just from the size of the herd, and the cryptographic
   structure encoding it, but also from the observability of access to
   shared state.  This document describes a privacy preserving state
   management system for digital credentials based on Oblivious HTTP
   that addresses both data model and protocol risks associated with
   digital credentials with dynamic state.

1.  Introduction

   Digitial Credentials often have a validity period, which indicates
   the time at which the claims become active for the subject according
   to the issuer, and the time at which the issuer specifies the claims
   are no longer to be considered asserted by the issuer.

   A typical example is a digital drivers license, which has an
   activation date, and an expiration date.

   When the activation date is in the past, and the expiration date is
   in the future, we consider the license to be valid at the current
   time.

   A verifier might wonder if such licenses are suspended or revoked,
   even if the validity period is acceptable.

   A common solution is to the issuer of the credential to provide a
   resource that reflects information about the state of the credential
   over time.

   Because issuer's track the presentation of digital credentials if a
   verifier where to ask the issuer about the state of a specific
   digital credential, it common to see credential states be merged into
   blocks, or herds, where an issuer can deliver the block to the
   verifier upon request, without learning which specific digital
   credential the verifier is interested in.

   Unfortunatly, the metadata associated with resolving credential state
   can leak time and location information about the presentation of
   credentials over time.

   This document addresses this risk by introducing a mediator which is
   trusted by the verifier.

2.  Credential State

   To simplify interpretation of resolution of credential state
   resources, this document uses the following aliases for the terms
   defined in [RFC9458].

   The Verifier's Software is the Oblivious HTTP Client.

   The Mediator's Credential State Resource is the Oblivious Relay
   Resource.

   The Issuer's Gateway Resource is the Gateway Resource.

   The Issuer's Credential State Resource is the Target Resource.

   The critical privacy property is obtained by the verifier's client
   relying on the Mediator's Credential State Resource instead of
   Issuer's Credential State Resource.

   In order to achieve this property, while preserving the property that
   issuer's do not know which verifier's will be interested in dynamic
   state information associated with their credentials, the issuer
   includes the identifier for their Issuer's Credential State Resource
   in their credential claim sets, however the verifier rewrites this
   URL to be their Mediator's Credential State Resource before
   resolution.

   Editor note: is there a simpler solution here?

    .--------.         +----------+         .-------.
   | Verifier +<------>+ Mediator +<------>+ Issuer  |
    '--------'         +----------+         '-------'

2.1.  Identifier

   While many different protocol schemes can be used to identify
   resources, to improve interoperability and reduce attack surface,
   this document requires credential state resources to be identified
   with https URLS, as described in [WHATWG.URL].

   The following URI Templates, as described in [RFC6570] are required
   to improve interoperability and reduce the chances of degrading the
   privacy properties through the inclusion of extraneos information in
   the identifiers embedded in credentials.

   *  issuer MUST support internationalizaton considerations, as
      described in [WHATWG.URL], for example: üèõÔ∏è.example

   *  mediator MUST support internationalizaton considerations, as
      described in [WHATWG.URL], for example: üöõ.example

   *  resource-name MUST be a URN as described in [RFC4122], for
      example: urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6

2.1.1.  Issuer's Credential State Resource

   https://{issuer}\
   /credential-states/{resource-name}

   https://üèõÔ∏è.example\
   /credential-states/urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6

2.1.2.  Mediator's Credential State Resource

   https://{issuer}.{mediator}\
   /credential-states/{resource-name}

   https://üèõÔ∏è.example.üöõ.example\
   /credential-states/urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6

2.2.  Resources

   Credential state resources typically rely on a similar content type
   as the credentials that require them.

   Mixing different content types for credentials and their state,
   increases implementation costs and harms interoperability.

   The credential state resource MUST be secured with the same content
   type that was used to secure the digital credential that has dynamic
   state.

   For example, a JSON Web Token, [RFC7519] based digital credential
   must rely on a [RFC7519] based credential state resource.

   There are many different content types that can be used to secure
   digital credentials, this document does not require a specific
   content type to be used.

   The Accept header MUST be supported, and the application/cose content
   type SHOULD be supported.

2.3.  Processing Credential State Resources

   Validation of the digital credential state MUST occur after
   verification.

   Validation of the digital credential validity period MUST occur
   before credential state checks.

   Implementers are cautioned that concepts like "suspended" or
   "revoked" are interpretted differently and used differently by
   issuers.

   All dynamic claims provided through credential state resources MUST
   be considered issuer defined, and cannot be interpretted globally.

   Interpretting the structure of the Issuer's Credential State Resource
   is outside the scope of this document.

   However, other documents describe this process in detail.

   [W3C.VC-BITSTRING-STATUS-LIST] provides guidance on processing
   resources that secure the content type application/vc+ld+json, such
   as application/cose.

   [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-status-list] provides guidance on processing
   resources of the content type application/cwt, and application/jwt.

2.4.  Techniques for Herd Privacy

2.4.1.  Bitmaps

   In this approach, the size of the herd is the length of the bitmap,
   and the state of a digital credential claim is the value of the bit
   at a given index.

   Scaling this approach can be difficult, as a seperate list is needed
   for each dynamic claim in a digital credential.

   This scalling challenge can be partially addressed by consuming
   multiple bits at a given index, however, the resulting enumeration
   needs to be consistently understood.

   A common solution to consistent interpretation of enumerations is the
   establishment of a registry, however this can become impractical
   depending on the nature of the issuer's need to express dynamic
   state.

   Publishing a dictionary per issuer, or per sets of issuer's can help
   address these challenges for some use cases.

2.4.2.  Cryptographic Accumulators

   [ZKA] describes an approach to expressing proofs of set membership.

2.4.3.  Bloom Filters

   Appendix B.2.7 of [RFC8932] mentions an application of bloom filters,
   that can be applied to communicating credential state assuming the
   probabilistic nature of bloom filters is acceptable to the verifier.

2.4.4.  Transparency Services

   Tree structures, such as described in
   [I-D.draft-mcmillion-keytrans-architecture] can be used to provide
   advanced membership proofs, such as proving inclusion, consistency,
   non inclusion, and freshness.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
